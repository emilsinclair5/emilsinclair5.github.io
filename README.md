"Die böse Welt indessen **begann** schon mitten in unserem eigenen Hause."

"Meanwhile, the world of evil **began** there already, right in the middle of our house."

  The character of Emil Sinclair is portrayed as someone who is weak but someone who possesses a good amount of potential. He is commonly represented by an egg or a newly hatched chick. Even his weapon named vogel is a reference to the line "Der Vogel kämpft sich aus dem Ei", which translates to "The bird fights its way out of the egg" in Herman Heese's Demian.
